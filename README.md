# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project
### Purpose
The purpose of this project is to try to understand how other campaigns fared in relation to launch dates and funding goals. This will help Louiseâ€™s on her fundraising.

## Analysis and Challenges
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
Based on the picture below, I recommend to launch the campaing in May, June or July. On those months, the successul over failed ratio is 2 to 1, which is double the average ratio of 1 to 1.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
Depending on how much money is needed for the project, the chances to succeed is around 75% for a goal of less $5000.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
The challenges I encountered are related to understanding the request and sumarize the resutls in a few sentences. I spent most of my time writing the README file.

## Results
- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
1. The best month to launch a campaign is May.
2. The worst month to launch a campaign is December.
- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
1. Since the purpose of this capmaign is to raise money, I will suggest to set the goal between $1000 and $5000, and avoind setting goals between $25000 and $35000 as well as over $45000.
- What are some limitations of this dataset?
1. The City column is missing. To have a better prediction we will need to analize the data by City. People behaves differently between cities.
2. The dataset does not contain recent campaings. The most recent data points are from 2017 which represents only 12 percent of the data collected in 2015.
- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
1. Number of campains per year.
2. Launch Day of the week versus success and faild.
3. Campaing duration (number of days).
