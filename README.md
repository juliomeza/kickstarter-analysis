# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project
### Purpose
The purpose of this project is to know how other campaigns fared in relation to launch dates and funding goals.


## Analysis and Challenges
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
The best months to launch a campaing are May, June and July. Where the successul over failed ratio is 2 to 1, which is double the average ratio of 1/1.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered


## Results
- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
1. The best month to launch a campaign is May.
2. The worst month to launch a campaign is December.
- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
1. Since the purpose of this capmaign is to raise money, I will suggest to set the goal amount between $1000 and $5000, and avoind setting the goal amounts between $25000 and $35000 as well as over $45000.
- What are some limitations of this dataset?
1. To have a better prediction we will need to analize the data by City. People behaves differently between cities.
2. The dataset does not contain recent campaings. The most recent data points are from 2017 which represents only 12 percent of the data collected in 2015.
- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
1. Number of campains per year.
2. Day of the week launch date versus success and faild.
3. Campaing number of days.
