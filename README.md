### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered


## Results
- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
1. The best month to launch a campaign is May.
2. The worst month to launch a campaign is December.
- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
Since the purpose of this capmaigns is to raise money, I will conclude that the best goal is any amount between $1000 and $5000, and to avoid goals between $25000 and $35000 as well as over $45000.
- What are some limitations of this dataset?

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
